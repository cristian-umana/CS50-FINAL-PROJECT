# CS50-FINAL-PROJECT

CONCEPT:

“Tell Me About It!” is a website meant for users to share short anonymous stories, either stories which seek advice or stories which seek to give advice about a given subject, to a forum in which their stories can be tagged and viewed with others stories or advice with similar tags. The site is designed to be completely anonymous and prompt users to participate in a public conversations space without the pressure of direct messaging or false expectation of seeking direct answers - instead the site creates a space where stories dealing with similar issues can be seen together and users can gain perspective and a sense of shared experience safely and anonymously


LAUNCH:

The site’s landing page features a logo displaying the name of the website “Tell Me About It!” which references the site concept - a forum to post stories and advice. Beneath the logo are two buttons which will direct the user to either “TELL” (share some type of story) “LISTEN” (see what stories have been shared by others), as well as a third button labeled “NOT SURE WHERE TO START?” which will direct users to an about page explaining the site concept and basic usage/flow. The launch page also features a navigation bar at the top of the page by which any page on the website can be reached - this nav bar is consistent across all pages.


ABOUT:

The about page features an explanatory diagram mapping the usage of both “TELL” and “LISTEN” as well as “TELL” and “LISTEN” buttons at the bottom of the page which will then route users to the corresponding site functions. 


TELL:

When “TELL” is selected, the user will be directed to a simple page with two buttons labeled “TELL STORY” and “SHARE ADVICE”. When “TELL STORY” is clicked, the user will be routed to a page with an input box and a number of “tag” options floating beneath. Upon writing a story in the text field and selecting however many “tags” which relate to the story shared, the user can click the button labeled “SEND YOUR FEELINGS TO THE ETHER” which will submit their story with all chosen tags and route them to the “LISTEN” page. The “SHARE ADVICE” page has an identical format and usage, but is intended for users who would like to share words of wisdom rather than stories which seek to vent or prompt advice. 


LISTEN:
The “LISTEN” page features a graphic which visualizes previous posts color coded by tag. Underneath this visualization are two tables which display all “STORIES” (featured in the table on the left) and “ADVICE” shared (featured in the table on the right). There are also two buttons displayed directly above the the tables labeled “FILTER STORIES” and “FILTER ADVICE” which will direct the user when clicked to “listening pages” specifically for “stories” or “advice” where the user can then pick a tag and see all posts relating with their tag of choice.
